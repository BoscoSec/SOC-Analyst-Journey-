# 4. DNS (Domain Name System)

## What is DNS?

DNS translates human-readable domain names
into IP addresses.

Example:

google.com → IP address

Computers use IP addresses to communicate
with other devices and servers.

## How DNS Works

1. User enters a domain name.
2. Computer checks its DNS cache.
3. DNS resolver looks for the answer if needed.
4. Resolver queries the DNS hierarchy.
5. Authoritative DNS server provides the answer.
6. Resolver returns the IP address.

## Common DNS Record Types

| Record | Purpose |
|---|---|
| A | Maps domain to IPv4 address |
| AAAA | Maps domain to IPv6 address |
| MX | Identifies email servers |
| CNAME | Creates a domain alias |
| TXT | Stores text information and verification data |

## Why is it important for SOC?

DNS logs can help analysts identify
suspicious domain lookups.

Examples:
- Connections to known malicious domains.
- Unusual randomly generated domains.
- Queries to newly registered domains.
- Repeated suspicious DNS requests.

Malware may use DNS to communicate with
Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
